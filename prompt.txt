✅ General Rules for Good Prompts

Be explicit about the resource (pods, deployments, nodes, services).

Specify the namespace if not default.

Mention the format (table, wide, JSON, YAML).

Ask for filtering (by labels, status, etc.).

Use action words (get, describe, scale, delete, create).

Combine context and command (“show pods in namespace dev sorted by age”).
