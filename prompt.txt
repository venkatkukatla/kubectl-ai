Create two YAML files and save them in the current directory /mnt/c/Users/venka/k8s/prompt:

1. Save as /mnt/c/Users/venka/k8s/prompt/deployment.yml
   - Deployment with 4 replicas
   - Image: nginx:latest
   - Container name: nginx
   - Label: app=nginx

2. Save as /mnt/c/Users/venka/k8s/prompt/service.yml
   - Service of type LoadBalancer
   - Selector: app=nginx
   - Expose port 80

After saving, run:
ls -l /mnt/c/Users/venka/k8s/prompt

After creating the files, deploy them into the current EKS cluster.
